Things to do 
1. Check merged balance: smote, augement, over/under sample [BEFORE SPLIT]
2. Check FT D++ model (scores, conf mtrx)
3. Hyper parms tune:


Struct
|- pretrained set CIFAKE
    |- imported model 
        |- fine tune set: 1/20 of 140K R/F
        |- fine tune set2: custom

Models Ideas
1. Make own dataset (GrokAI, SomeOnlineTool)
    a. use roboflow to give classification R/FT
2. Train on 1/20 for 8 hrs
    a. make sure it is connect to G Drive
3. re train on custom


## Perhpas make it API able!!!!

## Using base model saved takes maybe 4hrs
## For each one there is a base model


## Styles
1. Image (Base)
    a. News? (Common in deepfakes sets) [https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet]
    b. !Social (Mid Journery, GROK AI)
    c. !Medical [https://medmnist.com/]

2. Video (Base)
    a. !multi modal: video and subtitles
    b. sign language [https://github.com/sign-language-processing/datasets]

3. Text (Base)
    a. articles
    b. !captions
    c. chatbot?
